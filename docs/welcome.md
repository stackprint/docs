[Stackprint](https://stackprint.io/) is a web platform for building REST APIs fast without writing any code. Our mission is to enable everyone to build web- and mobile apps faster by saving time when building the necessary REST APIs for managing data.

We believe that when you have limited time to build an app or you're creating an MVP to test the market, you should not spend your time coding another REST API yourself. Your time is better spent working on what makes your app stand out.

That's why Stackprint allows you to build REST APIs by just connecting with your authentication provider and configuring the data that your API will manage using our intuitive API Editor. Deployments happen with one click.
